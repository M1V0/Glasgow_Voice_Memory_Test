Steps:

- The 16 sounds (out of 24) that were actually used during the original version of the GVMT sounds were selected
- Sounds were renamed to be easily handled with OpenSesame (filename correspondance in Sounds.ods)
- Sounds were resampled at 44100 Hz
- Sounds were normalized (see normalization reference sounds)
- Sounds duration was adjusted to be 1500 ms (to get the right SOA in the training phase)
